# producktivity-tracker
<i>A productivity tracker app published on Google Play. Includes Google AdMob and in-app-purchases to disable ads.</i>

This project was created because I and the rest of the world want a good, customizable app that can be used without having to pay a premium.
The inspiration for this app come from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en_US&gl=US. If the app had allowed me to track more than 4 projects at a time without paying a premium, then I would have never learned to do this so maybe I should be thanking them? (my app let you track an unlimited number of projects for free!)
